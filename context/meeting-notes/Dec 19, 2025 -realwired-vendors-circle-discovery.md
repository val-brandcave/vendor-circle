### Demo (YouConnect Circle (Vendor’s Side)

- Context
    - Vendors are emailed reports
    - From the bank, the vendor needs to keep their details up to date
    - Vendor is emailed a link. Sometimes this link requires MFA
    - They go in to update their credentials in a web form
    - They had to update their credentials for every bank
    - The Vendor’s Circle is a central server
        - So they can update their credentials one time and update all banks
    - They all have a page called “My Requests”
        - Bids Needed
        - Bids Submitted
        - Bids Needing Confirmations
        - Reports in Process
        - Reports Needed Rework
        - Their basic information
    - The vendors are supposed to bookmark page
    - They currently have a bookmarked page for every bank
    - The new portal should provide them to see their assignments in one place
    - The links direct the user to a web form where they can respond to bids
- YouConnect Circle
    - circle-dev.realwired.com
    - “My Requests”
    - “My Invites”
        - This shows the banks that have invited you to join them
        - When accepting an invite, there are bank-specific forms they’ll need to submit
    - “Licenses”
        - This is where the user updates their licensing, like W9, Sample Works, etc, resume
        - Licenses by state. You add a license by selecting the state, then add the license number, file and an expiration date
        - Master Agreement
        - Auto License
        - General Commercial Liability
    - “Profile”
        - Bid coordinator, assistant emails, user’s emails, general information
        - Banks can reject changes to a vendor’s profile
            - HOW DOES THIS WORK?
        - Addresses
        - Coverage Areas
            - Select state, then select counties in each state
        - Banks
            - These are just the banks they serve
- Goal
    - A more community approach: I don’t want it to feel like an inbox. I want it to feel like a conversation.
    - “I want them to feel like, without this product I won’t be able to have successful communications with banks”
- Jeff Notes
    - The relationship between Chief Appraisers and vendors is an arms length. Vendors want work from banks, Banks criticize their works, and there are weird fees here.
    - Sometimes appraisers can feel like reviewers are too nitpicky. Improving that relationship would be good from both sides, and no one has ever attempted this.
    - If you could gamify this in a professional way, you could encourage the communication between the two.
    - Even calling someone a vendor is lightly offensive. As an appraiser, it should be a relationships.
    - You don’t currently get any feedback, kudos, emojis, nothing. The only time you hear back is when there is a problem.
    - Both sides really need each other. Both sides come from bank work.
    - We want to elevate the appraiser and the chief appraiser.
    - All information has to stay on the order
        - They can’t be making comments about orders in YouConnect
    - Very subtle, very light communication that makes you feel valued
    - How is our relationship going?
        - Should I change something? Should I stop doing something?
    - There is an AI review product they’re rolling out
        - Currently it only serves the bank side
        - Before they send it they could opt in to do the review
    - More engagement === allows us to put products in front of these people
    - These are typically men: more technicians
        - If I send a report and you critique it, I’d feel embarrassed or mad
    - How would you professional engage with your client?
    - If there are no issues with an order, there’s no feedback loop. You might get a generic email that says the review is complete (they get paid, that’s it)
    - So appraisers hold their breath when they submit their appraisal
    - There can be back and forth from the bank. They might ask those questions, they might fix typos.
    - In the product, that happens in a chat window
    - Some appraisers just make the revisions and upload it with no comments
    - Some will disagree and want a phone call
    - The bank will sometimes change details
    - Appraiser can tell if they’re getting pushback. If they do 5 submittals and get 3 pushbacks, they know that they’re not doing well.

    - Uber Rating / B- ← implicit grading
    - You can see the stats of the vendor vs other vendors
        - There are stats we can pull from to make it more efficient

        - Avg Price Point
        - Avg Number of Revisions
    - Bank provides feedback
- Bank Side
    - Ability to invite the vendor
    - Then you can see the pending invites
        - Then you can see if the invite was accepted or pending
    - You can also see the vendor updates
        - They can accept/reject changes
- Scope of the UX
    - Bank
        - The redesign of the vendor’s circle to generally improve the UX ← Phase 1 better ux
        - We need to design the mechanisms that encourage the bank to leave positive feedback following the approval of an appraisal
    - Vendor
        - The redesign of the platform to generally improve the UX ← Phase 1 better ux
        - Feedback loop that tells the vendor at aggregate how they’re doing, and surface the positive things that are said about them, benchmarks
