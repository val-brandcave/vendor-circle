## Key Quotes (For Context)

### From Ed Kruger (Client, Jan 6, 2026):
> "Right now I just need to hit parity. So parity means that I've got a customer like our biggest competitor called RIMS. They've got a product called 360."

**Translation:** RIMS is the benchmark. Match them first, differentiate later.

### From Jeff Hicks (Client, Discovery Call):
> "Improving that relationship would be fantastic from both sides of the fence. And it's never really been viewed that way. It's never been tried."

**Translation:** Relationship features are unexplored territory. This is our Phase 2 differentiator.

> "Even calling somebody a vendor is lightly offensive. It's not a relationship, right?"

**Translation:** Cultural/identity problem. We must respect vendors as professionals, not commodities.

### From Sunda Scanlon (Client, Discovery Call):
> "If you work for 10 of our banks, you'd have to update these same exact credentials 10 different times for 10 different banks."

**Translation:** Core problem statement. One profile for all banks is the innovation.
