  It's looking good. Oh, sweet.

0:02 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Yeah, that's what we're going to be showcasing to Ed today. Cool. All righty. How's your day going? 

11:17 - ed
  All right. Yeah.

11:22 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  so what we have here is your standard catalog of two user flows. This is not the actual sign-in screen, but essentially it would become the sign-in screen depending on which user.  Um, I want to stay here for a minute and ask you a couple of questions. So I know you are calling this Vendor Circle internally, but it's out there as a Uconnect Circle.  Is that the name that you're going to go with? And I understand from Jason's comment that the logo you were using, that was also random.  So I created something very quickly. So I just want to hear your thoughts on if you are interested in that, I could create something more custom or we could proceed with what we have.

12:00 - ed
  Yeah, so, you know, the clients haven't seen it, you know, it's a completely unlaunched product, you know, so I think we've just been talking, you know, around it as Circle, we don't have a logo, you know, we don't have an identity associated with it, so I'm very happy if you would help us to create it.  So, absolutely.

12:21 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Once you play with this, let me know how the current logo I created looks to you and proceed from there.

12:27 - ed
  Yeah.

12:29 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  So, this is an early draft, and most of the content that Jason has provided hasn't been filled in, so I have to extrapolate a lot, so bear with me on that.  So, when you get into the vendor circle page itself, the landing is my request page. We have our standard visual of that with a tabbed table view for the bits, which can be, of course, like, filtered out by which bank and which status they're at, as well as clearing them out.

12:58 - ed
  And, and...

13:00 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  And reports as well. Although a quick comment here before we continue. I wanted to understand like in the lead draft in the first phase at least, are you interested in more than just the redesign, maybe some extra additional opportunities such as adding some metrics or maybe some visuals of how many bits are converted into a report, a pie chart or something like that?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.

13:23 - ed
  Yeah. So I think like a big thing for us here is the product development in this product that's been done very poorly.  So there's definitely this idea of like a, you know, a phased implementation where, you know, right now I just need to hit parity.  So parity means that I've got a customer like our biggest competitor called RIMS. They've got a product called 360.  And they do this, you know, this vendors, vendors, you know, bidding solicitation side is something that they have, you know, well offered.  And then what they provide their customers are like, listen, you have one profile and RIMS and, you know, you can do all of the selection, you know.  through that one profile. And so we definitely want to get into that space. We believe the best approach to do that is via community, you know, like start the facilitation and engagement between these two parties, know, bring in, have people, you know, give them a reason to use this and then make this a tool for them to be successful.  So we do believe that that's the path forward, but where we are right now is we need to provide parity.  And so my question just to you is what would be the best way that we could do this in a way where we see this is where we are right now.  We just want to replace the as-is and launch. And then we want to figure out like how do we evolve into, you know, this secondary and this third goal that we have.

14:45 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Okay. To answer your question, I guess like Cody and I, let me walk you through what we have right now and we can best answer that because we have a little discussion on that.

14:57 - Cody Miles
  All right.

14:59 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  So moving on. Here, like, of course, I would expect the action would take them to the UConnect page where they actually see the bear, like, now it's a dummy.  And going into the My Invites itself, now we have a stacked invite list here that shows, like, which bank has sent and which was resend, what's the scope of the, you know, the invite.  They're asking the vendor for, I mean, who's contacted it, address, and there will be some information in the next iteration.  So user could accept that, send in thanks, and they can accept the bank request, or they could reject it, give the declining reason, and, yeah, go through all the requests, the invites here.  Also, finally, we had, I mean, we were calling it just the licenses, and inside licenses, it was credential licenses.  So I kind of, like, we used a word called My Documents instead, and within that, now we have, like, a better way to view the credentials, license, and insurance.  For example, in the credentials, have the W9, which the user could edit, add in the new document, maybe give it a title if they want, and they could delete it, but since that's an important document, we show a confirmation model and ask the user or prompt the user to add it at some point.  Same goes for the resume, edit, delete over there, and the sample reports that they want to showcase, Maximum, I guess, it's supporting currently four, so yeah, they can title the report rather than just calling it sample and have the file and display that.  I can't even add a new one. Moving on to the state licenses, so again, I went with a nice stable view of that, and if some licenses are expiring, I want to show a quick notification here.  Of course, user could either update the license or maybe even remove that, so that goes away. They can look into the individual license, the expiry date, the number, and the file itself to download, and coverage, similar experience.  And depending on the kind of coverage, I've seen only... Three different coverages or insurances, but I'm expecting there might be more.  So I modeled it to accept more kind of documents here, such as MSAs, et cetera, where you could use a model to kind of decide which kind of document they want to upload in any specific fields that are associated to that kind of document.  They'll be able to upload, add in the field inputs and present it here. And finally, within the vendor flow itself, by the way, we can do dark mode and light mode.  It's going to get better later. The profile of the vendor itself. So an ability to add the user avatar, quick display of that information, ability to change their email addresses, contact numbers, password, et cetera, as well as have a list of addresses that are associated with the business, making sure one of them is the primary.  They can set the other one as primary or edit that information, set it as primary, and it changes. we'll site highlight So then you go увидите whatever thought restart, and start....  on always This is something where the pill problem is now solved. It's a nice section of which coverage areas are here.  They can look into what all counties within each state. They can add a new state, search and select that, and maybe add that into the coverage area list.  The specialties, where the vendor is specialized in, they can, of course, add new specialties. Save that. And the professional designations they have, they can add, delete them as well.  They hold a card here. And finally, the connected banks itself. So I wanted to showcase them in tiles with the logo, when they have a connector, and then each department they got connected in, as well as they can view the profile of the bank or disconnect sending them by notice.  But, of course, this has to be worked out if current active order is with the bank, they can't do it, etc.  But this would be the experience for them. Yeah, that's where we are at on the user side of it.  Before I show the admin, if have any comments.

18:58 - ed
  Yeah, so... How are you dealing with businesses? So, for example, let's say I'm an appraisal office, right? And I've got six people that work for me, right?  And so how do we navigate that complexity? Because I was thinking when you were uploading the license and then you had the person associated with, like, where he is and what he does and, you know, what states he works in.  And, you know, something that jumped to me is just your information hierarchy is from the profile perspective and making that very individualistic, you know, but, like, you might be part of an office and that office might serve as an area, you know, and that's kind of like some of the complexity that we have to deal with.  That's a great point.
