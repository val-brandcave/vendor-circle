0:18 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Hey Jason, good afternoon.

0:46 - Cody Miles
  What's going on guys? Hey Gary. We got two Jasons in here.

1:30 - Jason
  Yeah, I'm not sure why there are other ones there. That could be kicked out. There we go. There it goes.  There it goes.

1:36 - Cody Miles
  Awesome. How are you, Jason? I was good until a minute ago.

1:41 - Jason
  I got to look up something. How are you doing? I'm good, man. Good.

2:17 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Hey, Ed.

2:23 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Oh, I'm talking to myself. That's up to you. Happy Friday.

2:30 - Cody Miles
  Happy Christmas week eve. Yeah. Week eve?

2:35 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  That's one way of saying it, yeah.

2:45 - Cody Miles
  So what?

2:58 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  so what in the plans, Cody? What are you up to this weekend? No rest for the wicked.

3:05 - Cody Miles
  Actually, no, my mother-in-law is coming to town, and when she comes in town, I get to have a date night, so my wife and I will get out tonight.  Oh, nice.

3:14 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Are doing special?

3:16 - Cody Miles
  I haven't even thought about it. I need to. I need to figure out what I'm going to do tonight.

3:21 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Oh, yeah. Dude, you're running out of time. It's pretty, yeah, we're in trouble.

3:26 - Cody Miles
  It's not going to go well.

3:31 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So, Jeff is not going to, he's going to join us in about 10 minutes. know, Jeff is our subject matter expert.  So, he's the guy that will really give us, like, clear answers on the domain, you know, that kind of stuff.  I know Sunda and Jason can do, you know, quite a lot from that, but I think Jason's, Jeff has got a vision, you know, that he's also chasing.  So, I think the best way for us to be productive in this sesh is let's look at... let's... let's...  let's... let's... let's... let's... you. What we have right now, and let's just unpack that from a UI UX perspective, know, ask some questions.  And I think by the time we would run through the demo, Jeff would join us on call. Beautiful.

4:18 - Cody Miles
  Who can lead that demo?

4:24 - Jason
  I'm out of pocket here, Sunda, I'm hoping you're able to do that.

4:27 - Sunda Scanlon
  Okay, well, so, hold on. Busy things going, wasn't ready for that, but I can do it. Where is, do you have it turned on where I can share?  There it goes. It's great. Entire screen, share, share.

4:57 - Jason
  If you want to use, I'm going to message you. Entire screen. Let me see if y'all can see my screen or not.

5:04 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yes. Okay. Nope. Nope. Hold on, I'll get there. Okay, so... Oh, I'm showing the vendor side, right? Yeah. Okay, here we go.

5:53 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So let's just give them a background about what the project is about and what we're trying to do. Yeah.  And, you know... What they are looking at. So let's just set the scene and then we go into kind of like going through the UI.  Okay.

6:09 - Sunda Scanlon
  So currently right now we have our vendors that support our banks. So the vendors provide the reports. And what happens is they get emailed a link currently.  And from the link, they have to keep their credentials up to date, right? So their licensing, their insurances, things like that.  So currently a vendor gets emailed a link and I'll just go to a page so you can see what that looks like for them.  Yeah, let give you a real life example. So when the vendor gets emailed a link, they go in and they update their credentials on a web form.  And so for each bank, they have this. So the issue with that is, is that if you work for 10 of our banks, you  We'd have to update these same exact credentials 10 different times for 10 different banks. So the current web form that they fill out looks like this.  So they get sent a link in an email. It opens up. There's certain things they're not able to change, just pretty much the first name, last name, and company.  That can only be changed by the bank. Is that this link, is it like, is it authenticated or do they have to log in in order to view this web form?  No, this is just a web form. So sometimes the banks have two MFA on it as a requirement. Some banks don't.  So with this one, it just gives them the opportunity to upload and it'll tell them what's missing. So this is their current.  And he has quite a few licenses. So you can imagine if he has all these licenses, he has to do this for each bank right now.  So what we did to resolve that issue is we made a vendor circle, which is a central server, and all of our vendors are going to be in that central server.  central server. And if they service, you know, one bank or 10 of our banks, at that point in time, that is going to now be available to them to go in and update their credentials the one time.  And it'll send a notification to all of those banks and let them vet those credentials that way. Still not letting one bank know about another.  Now, they all have a bookmark page. And what I mean by that is there's a page called My Request that they're very familiar with seeing since the inception has looked like this.  So any bids they need to respond to are here. Any bids submitted are here, and they can submit additional bids.  Any of the stuff needing confirmation goes in here. Reports in process go here. Rework means it got stuck in review.  And then they just have the basic information they can update at any time. They can't update their licenses and stuff at any time currently.  That's what, you know, it happens and it looks like. But this is their portal, for lack of better words.  They bookmark this page, and they can get to this page at any point in time. Now, there might be two MFA on this page as well, where when they click on a link, they have to put in a code to get there.  But this is their only access to Uconnect. Now, imagine if you serve 10 of our banks. You have 10 of these bookmarked pages you have to go between in order to make answers or do anything else, right?  Yeah. So what we try to do in the portal is give them the ability to see their assignments across all banks.  Now, it'll still bring them to the bank-specific web forms because each bank has custom web forms. And so one bank might have questions on their web form versus another.  But what the intent was is when you go into Vendor Circle, if you work for three banks, it would show Finance Bank and then all the bids that you need to submit for finance.  It might then show Bank of America and then all the bids you need to submit for Bank of America.  So if you work for three banks, the three bank names would be here and each would have their bids.  bids a a And then your bid submitted same way. If you work for three banks, it'll show. So it gives them one spot that they can go to and click on and access all of their assignments based on the workflow stage they're in.  It's very important to keep the workflow stage because if we just had links out there, that would not tell them or give them the proper overview of the actions needed to be taken.  OK.

10:23 - Cody Miles
  OK, so this is what this page looks like.

10:26 - Sunda Scanlon
  And that's why I wanted to show you that other current My Request page because they're very used to seeing this.  the only difference would be it would just have the bank name and then you would have additionals, right? So it kind of gives them their lay of the land.  So the most important thing to them is getting bids in and then getting the reports in on their due dates.  So currently, this would show just like this does if there were assignments in here. It would allow them to submit an additional bid or click on this link.  And when they click on this link, it brings them to their web form where they can actually answer this or respond to it.  If it's available. So the same thing, it'll be here. So this is their My Request page, which is currently their landing page when they first come in to the circle.  Okay. Another section is called My Invites. Jay, I'm getting a – on My Invites. don't – it doesn't look like this.  Yeah, it looks like we have some CICD stuff.

11:28 - Jason
  We're doing some development server upgrades right now. Yeah. So we'll have to get with Tom on that one. Okay.

11:36 - Sunda Scanlon
  So on this, My Invites, it would just show a line of a bank. If a bank has invited you to potentially join because the banks will be able to search, find vendors that they don't use, and then invite them.  When they get an invite, they can click on that invite, and then it'll walk them through bank-specific things they need to fill out just for that bank.  And so that's kind of a rudimentary thing. It's just a line that they see.

12:08 - Cody Miles
  This is the license page.

12:10 - Sunda Scanlon
  As I showed you on the other, my request for credentials, they upload their licensing. So a lot of banks require a W-9.  So they upload their W-9 here. If they have sample work, if they have multiple sample works, they can upload generally up to four.  That's what we have on our receptor form when it comes into the bank. They have four slots. They have one slot for a resume, one slot for a W-9.  So then you have the licenses. Now, it's not a – it shows one license, so you could upload a license.  If you have multiple licenses, you would then just upload each of your licenses, and you just select Add State License.  Right now, you pick your state. If it's Alaska, you hit Continue. And then you have Alaska right here where you're going to choose your file, your license number, and your expiration date.  So they're going to be able to keep their licenses up. Whenever they want to, and then whenever they make a change to one of these, it'll automatically notify the bank so they can accept or reject that change from them.

13:10 - Cody Miles
  Additional documentation. This is insurances.

13:13 - Sunda Scanlon
  So there's errors and omissions with an expiration date and a limit of liability. There's general commercial liability that has the expiration date.  They ask for the insurance company and the policy number. Auto liability. Not all of these are required for all sites.  So it's whatever the vendor uploads here. And if the bank needs something more specific, they can tell them and the vendor can update, upload that as well.  And then the master agreement. So again, this is kind of like generic for the vendor. I'm going to put all my stuff in here.  And then when it goes to specific banks, they'll be able to accept or reject it because maybe they don't do any work in Alabama.  So they don't want to hold their Alabama license. And then a master agreement. Not all of them have it.  So none of these things are required to fill in, but it's whatever the vendor chooses to fill in on this in order to be looked at.  That's selected and seen. The last page here is the profile page. So this is their email. If they have a big coordinator, they would put their email in here and assist an email.  And then they just have their general information, their first name, their last name, their middle name. And again, if they change it in here, that's fine because the bank can reject the changes if they want.  So if they change their last name, the bank may not want the new last name because they have to go through an approval process in order to be able to change something.  So company, title, work phone, cell phone. Some people still use fax, believe it or not. Address. Now, once they have that, they can also add additional addresses because some vendors have addresses in multiple locations and even in multiple states, depending.  So they can add whatever addresses they want to add by simply clicking add address and they fill in the base information and save that address.  And then coverage areas. And again, this is a kind of a generic coverage area because whatever bank invites them, they'll fill out the specific coverage areas and specific designations and things for that.  So on a coverage area, if I click add coverage area, I would just select a state and then I could add my counties for that state.  So if I was to choose multiple counties here, you'll see this is something that the team wasn't real fond of.  So it's Connecticut and then it shows it in this manner. It might be better if it was broke down visually where you could see in rows or columns or something like that.  But so that's how that is. So they can add different states and coverages. They'll have a designations one here.  You just are not seeing it because, again, this site obviously just was, this is just their bank list. This is just showing the banks they currently serve.  So if they serve. For banks, they would see Finance Bank, Bank of America, you know, Cadence Bank, East West Bank.  So that's just a list of banks. But we have another function called coverage area that, I mean, called designation that would be over there.  And then we have another one called vendor specialties, which works similar to this where they put it in and then it has a display for that.  But so I think that the larger portion of this is that the profile, way that this is displayed with the screen, you know, kind of so large, the readability or the aesthetic is not what the business was looking for.  Same when you're looking, mean, additional addresses isn't bad, but same, you know, just the look and feel for the page, essentially.  And Jeff, I believe, has a different logo that he'd be able to share that he wants to put on there.  So the profile page, maybe making it more palatable on the licensing page with keeping the same kind of sections so they have the understanding for that.  And I'm not sure on the My Request page. So there's the overview and I'll let the other powers at me make the comments.

17:10 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I think like a big thing for me is this, you can obviously see like this is the Tinder profile for vendors, you know, so this is basically what it is.  And I feel like, you know, we want them to spend some time on this page. We want them to kind of like interact and be sticky.  You know, we have a play. It's not going to come immediately, but we have a play in the new year to start thinking about a more community driven approach between these two parties, you know, facilitating communication faster, you know, that kind of stuff.  So not just being like an inbox, you know, I don't want it to just feel like an email inbox.  I want it to feel like a conversation. But a big thing for me is, is it's obviously, you know, that once we set up these profiles, that's what's going to match within, you know, the systems.  And then this is how you're going to retrieve it. So right now it feels like an inbox. I don't feel, I don't think that's necessarily the way that I want people to feel.  I don't want them to just visit it. I really want them to feel like without this product, they won't be able to have successful communication within the banking space.  Like it's really starting to drive those conversations.

18:23 - Sunda Scanlon
  You're just using the term email box, right? Because no emails go in here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

18:28 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I was like, I don't think emails go in here. Okay. Jeff, you want to add to that? Jeff, Jeff, Jeff?  Yes, yes, yes. All right.

18:46 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So which part of the community part or just how?

18:49 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, do you want to, I think what's important to Val and the team, to Cody and the team is really that they understand what is the experience we want to leave?  leave? Let's talk beyond just the UI, UX, but really talk about what is it that people we want to leave them with when they visit us and interact with it.  So can you speak a little bit to me with that? So I'll get to the community part of it.

19:19 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So this is the appraisers, the appraisers that actually do the work for the banks. And let's call them chief appraisers that work at the banks.  The relationship between the two has always been arm's length. So there isn't a great community. It's not hostile or anything, but it's definitely – they want work from the banks.  The banks have to review their work, so they get criticized on their work, and the fees are a little bit competitive.  So it's a weird relationship to where chief appraisers really do care about their fee appraisers. They want them to do the –  It's a great job because it's a risk management, right? If you mess up a $100 million loan, that's a big deal to the bank.  Sometimes the appraisers can feel that their reviewers are a little bit too nitpicky. And improving that relationship would be fantastic from both sides of the fence.  And it's never really been viewed that way. It's never been tried. So I think what Ed is getting at is if you could gamify it just in a professional light way, where you could encourage the communication between the two, even calling somebody a vendor is – so, for example, I'm a fee appraiser as well.  I still have an appraisal company. Calling me a vendor is lightly offensive. It's not a relationship, right? Right, right.  So I'll send in my work. I don't know how I'm doing. If I send 10 appraisals to this bank.  I don't know if they love my work. I know when they don't like it, I might get a review back.  But I don't get any kudos. don't get like, hey, guess what? You've uploaded the last 10 appraisals. Or let's say I submit an appraisal.  I don't get back a thumbs up, an emoji, just nothing. It's just crickets. The only time I hear back is when they have a problem.  So I think the long-term goal is, the initial goal is UX, UI. But ultimately, a community to where it improves their relationship because both sides really need each other.  Yeah. For a lot of appraisers, I'd say 50% of their revenue comes from bank work, but yet they're lightly derogatory, going, yeah, I do bank work.  So one of our things we try to do to elevate our industry in general is to elevate both the vendor or fee appraiser and the chief appraiser.  So this could be a nice way of kind of gamifying it. And that's why I don't know how you do it.

22:05 - Sunda Scanlon
  Jeff, as long as we know that we can't have communication about a report in here, it's got to stay on the order because audit purposes requires that all information stays there.  So we can't have them making the comments about orders in here.

22:21 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about is if I work with you guys and I did 10 projects for you and I don't know any feedback at all, there's not a relationship there.  And I know it's hard to create a relationship in a portal or in a UX UI, but I do think there's a way of engagement, just like the reason we all stare at LinkedIn and Facebook every day.  There's an engagement where we want to keep it professional, we're not going to, we're not looking to make this, you know, sharing pictures of our kids kind of thing.  But there could be some very subtle, very light lifting. Community things to where you do feel a bit more valued, you do have some communication as to not a specific report, but generally, how's our relationship going?  Should I change something? Should I stop doing something? How can I help you? You know, that kind of thing.  And just as Dr.

23:20 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Cody, the reason why I want to drive activity to this page from the vendor perspective is because, you know, you've heard about our AI Review Forms product that we want to roll out in the new year, we believe that it can serve both sides.  know, currently it serves only the banking side, you know, they get the benefit of it. But what we are hoping for is if we can drive a little bit more activity from this side, then maybe before they send it, they can opt in to do the review, you know, and then, you know, self-direct and then send it back to the bank, you know, minimizing, you know, repetitive strain.  You repetitive loops, you know, back and forth, like just reducing a little bit of the anxiety. But the idea is that if we have a little bit more engagement on this side, it would be easier for us to kind of like put products in front of these people, you know, where they would feel the benefit of the system already.  But now like the enhancement, you know, and again, leaving with that feeling that, oh, you know, I really suck without this, you know, with this product, like my work just goes so much faster, so much easier.

24:33 - Cody Miles
  The thing that I'm hearing that is the more innovative idea is just the feedback loops of how's our relationship going, what do I need to change in order to improve, you know, should I stop doing something?  So that becomes a, if I'm understanding the flow correctly, as when an order is complete, there's an opportunity to give feedback in the appraiser that would have the ability to see that feedback in here, and that's potentially how we gamify it.  But I'm curious how, and tell me if I'm wrong about any of that, But also, is there any effort to try to make the way that the appraisers give feedback more contextual and improve there and allow for conversation even within specific challenges?  Yeah, me and Jeff have been talking about it quite a while.

25:14 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Jeff, do you want to pick it up? Yeah, first I want to pick up the personalities.

25:18 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So these are older, typically men that are professional.

25:21 - Sunda Scanlon
  They're very smart. They're very analytical.

25:25 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So they're more of technicians. So the reason the relationship isn't, it's not bad, but it could be a lot better, is because they're a technician.  And if I send you, let's say you're my client, I send the report and you critique it, I feel bad.

25:42 - Sunda Scanlon
  I feel embarrassed.

25:43 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  I feel maybe mad because I'm a technician. And they're less business people and a little bit more technicians. So that's the creative challenge for this is how would you professionally engage with your client and kind of game?  Fathom to where you want to improve, but yet you're a analytical professional that's, and that's why it's been a challenge.  I've done other areas. have an educational content where we try to promote and elevate the industry. So they desperately want to be elevated and improve the relationship.  I don't think they know how. Those side do not know how to do that.

26:27 - Cody Miles
  Yeah. But your theory, Jeff, just to make sure I'm following, is you improve the relationship by not just being German and providing feedback only when it's bad feedback, but also providing positive feedback and encouragement.  Yeah. So, and again, excuse me, I lost my voice.

26:45 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Let's say I'm an Uber driver and I don't have any ratings. I keep picking up people and dropping off people.  I have no idea how I'm doing. If I get three, three out of five stars, I know I need.  Room for improvement, but if I'm an appraiser and I got the three stars, I might be, like, confused. It might generate maybe questions and unwarranted, you know what mean, where the chief appraiser, I don't want to answer these appraisers why I gave them three stars and he thinks they deserve five stars.  Yeah. Because these are, again, these are, I won't say sensitive, might be the wrong word, but it's a, it's a unique relationship to where I think if it was just improve the communication a little bit, would be a lot of it.

27:37 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yeah. And also consider this, sometimes you have an appraisal department that has three reviewers or four job managers and you have a thousand reports that came in that week.  are not going to want to comment or give ratings on each item, you know what I mean? So you have to think of that as well.  So we're not talking about maybe forcing it, right? Yeah. For just. Any giving availability for them that 15 stars or something on that?  Yeah, let me reframe this.

28:07 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So we started a not-for-profit, and we provide educational content once a month to chief appraisers. And really what we're teaching them is to leadership and elevate the industry.  I'm not going to say they're sad, but, you they're the back of the bank. They're our cost center. They're not like the fund lenders that make money from the bank.  They're a risk compliance department. So they kind of act that way. So this is why I need to be a creative where we're leading.  So as we do content, it's met with, why do I want to go to a seminar on leadership? I'm just an appraiser or a reviewer or whatever I am at the bank appraisal department.  But yet when they experience the content we give them, like, that was amazing. That was great. So we're leading them.  So This is not a normal thing in the appraisal workflow space. It's very transactional, very ARPs-like, but introducing, and I'm talking in a very small way.  This is not like Facebook, but a very subtle, professional community engagement where I would nod my head going, oh, this is pretty cool.  I feel like on both sides that they've got improved the relationship, if you will, and maybe this isn't impossible.  I don't know. Currently, what's the way that they receive feedback when they submit an order?

29:36 - Cody Miles
  So how does the bank communicate changes?

29:39 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Nothing. Well, okay, let's say I submit an appraisal to my platform or anybody's platform. I get it, and there's been a review and there's no issues.

29:48 - Sunda Scanlon
  I get nothing. No email.

29:52 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Just nothing. You either get paid or you don't.

29:56 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  That's how you know it was okay. Right. I might get an email that said... said... said...

30:00 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  A generic, hey, the appraisal review is complete. I forget what our system does. But there is no, I thought you did a great job, just super cool, you know, maybe one sentence about it, nothing.  20-page report and you just get crickets. So when you submit reports, you kind of hold your breath going, okay, is it going to come back?  Especially if it's a complex appraisal. So you're really just waiting. So if you get any feedback whatsoever, it's going to be a reviewer.  going to say, hey, I've got 10 questions on your appraisal. And what typically happens, there can be some back and forth since an appraisal is an opinion of market value.  There could be some pushback of, I disagree with points three and four, but I fixed the typos on questions number one, seven, and nine.  There may be some disagreements. Some appraisers feel like they're... ... ... I don't know, too perfect or infallible and kind of cross your arms aren't very helpful.  Those embrasures that get thrown off the list if they're not cooperative. So that is a feedback you get, which is, hey, here's 10 issues, please fix.  You send it back. Thanks. That's it.

31:22 - Cody Miles
  That's currently happening through the portal currently, right, through the order. So they have to log in to submit that.

31:36 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  The report revision process?

31:39 - Jason
  Yeah. just through something that currently works out.

31:42 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  We have a little chat window, chat window, and we just say, hey, I made changes on pages, whatever. I mean, or I just made the revisions, upload the revised report.  Even that, that's a great question.

31:58 - Sunda Scanlon
  Do you know what you mean to help? Sorry. I guess my mic goes off. I got an answer for him, Simon.

32:02 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So the difference is if somebody sends me a report and I have revisions, some appraisers just make the revisions and just upload it with no comments.  Some make some, they chat into the, you know, they put into the box, hey, I disagree with this. Let's get on a phone call or let's email back and forth.  The smarter appraisers will, at the end, say to expedite your review because you've already read this entire report, let me tell you what I've done.  I've changed page 20, 48, 98, and the value at the end, the value of the property went from 10 million to 2.2 million.  Some appraisers don't do that. So as a reviewer, I'm like, seriously, I had to go through your, I had to fix your, some of your things, and you're making me go throughout the document trying to find where you made those edits.  So Improving even that communication would be helpful. You know, what revision edits you actually made so I don't have to plow through the document looking for it.  So they do have an open communication and you connect.

33:13 - Sunda Scanlon
  It's a chat window that they can go back and forth. And most reviewers just, as Jeff said, just do the review.  You do have some reviewers that will go back and if they didn't find any errors, they'll say, hey, great report.  Thanks for your business or, you know, whatever. So they do have the ability to do it. They just don't do it.

33:31 - Jason
  So brainstorming an idea here. So when that report comes through and they accept it and move the status inside you connect, what if we showed a five random of a pool of 100 or so, like quick emote responses where they close, they hit one of them, and that is what it could send back.  So something easy and quick for the JM, the process.

33:55 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I mean, like team, like, let's just keep focused. That's the problem. problem. That's You know, of community is one that we want to fix in the near future.  Where we are today is just making sure that we find a UI, with this. So I want to leave Cody with that.  Like, I think there's a lot for him to unpack and to do. Like, there's a version one, and there's definitely the version of the future that we need to discuss here.  I'm just mindful of time because we probably need to jump on to the next one. I'm not quite sure what has been organized well.

34:31 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  We have our 4 o'clock.

34:32 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  We have our 4 o'clock. Yeah.

34:35 - Sunda Scanlon
  So I think the number one issue right now to be resolved because we're about to be launching this in the first quarter is making the profile more palatable of a page as well as the licensing.  So it's just spread out in the two columns and everything right now. The MyRequests, they're very used to this.  So, you know... Thank Again, at ListEach Bank, we'd have to keep these headers because they have to understand what flow their work is in.  It's just a way to bring them to the web forms that they need to populate or respond to. And again, we can't see the invites because the page is like this, but it's just a line saying that they're invited and they click a button.  But I believe that this is the primary concern initially. Is that right, Jeff? What's that?

35:24 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yeah, the UI UX. layout, the UI UX for the profile and the licenses.

35:28 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, I like the old one. Yeah, maybe. Sunda, do we have the other side of this that we can demo by any chance?  So on the bank side? Yeah. One moment, please.

35:43 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  And one thing for Cody, as Sunda does that, one thing that would be super interesting to the fee appraisers, but the chief appraisers probably don't want to disclose this because they're going to get annoyed appraisers, is to show the grading system.  you. You know, that definitely gamifies it, but it's going to, the chief appraisers aren't going to disclose it because they're going to get overly sensitive appraisers going, why am I rated at a two or whatever?  Right, right. That is the relationship we're trying to improve, but you can't really show it. So if you talk about stars, you talk about an actual weighted average scorecard and each bank kind of rates their vendors differently, that would be ideal.  But I don't think it's going to happen because it would just, it would cause more drama, I think, to the appraisers than it's worth.  They'd rather say, okay, Jeff Hicks is a B-appraisal, so let's make sure we give him B-assignments. So Jeff, you gave up, you came up with a great idea before.

36:49 - Jason
  It's really implicit grading. What you mean by, what you meant by that is you'd be able to see stats based off of that vendor versus other vendors and why they lost a deal or what.  What they can do to move their fee up $100, right? So there's some stats that we can pull from and show and guide them to how to become more efficient, more effective with the reports that could kind of guide that fee a little bit.  You mean give them advice how to do better the next time?

37:18 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yes, exactly.

37:19 - Jason
  And also how to bid in a way that you're most likely to get accepted based off of how fast you can turn around, what the price point is, and compare yourself with other vendors.  Right.

37:30 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yeah, it's a fine line between teaching them what they should already know versus maybe giving them data. Hey, guess what?  You've, you know, you've submitted 10 reports in the last month. Congratulations. Oh, by the way, only 20% of them needed light revisions.  You know what mean? It's like this. Yes, yes. Telling your new girlfriend, you're kind of pretty. Yes.

37:54 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  It's kind of a weird.

37:57 - Sunda Scanlon
  You're kind of pretty. All right, go ahead, Sunda. That's terrible. Okay, so on the Uconnect side, as a new tab in Circle, a bank has the ability to go search for a vendor with a certain specialty or whatever they want, and then they can preview that vendor.  So if they click the eyeball on the vendor, which I'm not getting that when I go on this one, Jason, I'm getting this.

38:26 - Jason
  Yeah, mean, stuff's flying behind the scenes exactly right before this call, so I'm not sure he's inside of our control right now.  Yeah, Tom's doing something.

38:36 - Sunda Scanlon
  But generally, it pops up and gives you the information, yeah, about the vendor. And I did send Val a video covering all this.

38:47 - Jason
  Okay, okay.

38:49 - Sunda Scanlon
  So that's the pop-up that normally would happen if you had it, but for some reason right now, it's just not wanting to do it.  All that does is just show. The profile information of the vendor, right?

39:02 - Cody Miles
  Right. So when you're on Circle, I'll do it on this page.

39:07 - Sunda Scanlon
  This just shows the profile. And if they are interested in that vendor, they hit this little button to invite them, or from here they can invite them.  And it just gives the generic information that the vendor has. And then if they invite them, then the vendor filled out the bank-specific information at that time.  And then once that happens, this just shows a list of the pending invites. Over here, I would normally have the names by them and everything, so they know if it was sent, if they accepted it, or whatever happened.  And then the vendor updates is what happens when the credentials come in. So this is kind of in a way where it's improved quite a bit because they used to have to go to the vendor record, click on each item, validate that item, move the stuff there.  Now here, they're able to click on the item, and it pops up a box, and they can actually do the whole thing right there where they can get that.  License and everything. If they don't want something, they can just click the X and they don't accept that change.  So it just doesn't update the vendor record. If they accept it, then it updates the vendor record in their vendor list.

40:14 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Just from an interest perspective, Sunar, like, let's say I'm a vendor. I mean, I'm asking a question now. We just should probably not ask a domain question, but I'm learning.  Would everybody be kind with me and learn with me together? Let's go. Awesome. So what happens when John Smith says, sorry, my name is actually John, you know, Casey, and he updates it, they reject it over a year.  Does John Smith's surname change in his own system? Like, does it propagate to everybody else? No.

40:47 - Sunda Scanlon
  So what happens is it would change in vendor circle. And if this specific bank rejected that change in their vendor list, which is different from every other banks and their vendor list, he would not have that update.  Now, generally what happens when they update a name, when a woman gets married and her name changes, the bank has a process they have to follow through in order to ensure that's still that vendor and switch out that name on the list.  So they probably reject it from here and then reach out to that vendor and have them fill out a paperwork that they have to submit back in for proof of name change.  To Ed's question, the answer is yes, though.

41:26 - Jason
  So all the other banks who receive that update, they have the option to accept a decline as well. Correct.  Correct. So some banks will accept because it's not in their policy to validate.

41:35 - Sunda Scanlon
  Some banks won't accept the name change, which is why we don't let them change their name right now. So if you work for East West Bank right now and you had a name change, you can't change that on your vendor profile, nor can you change your company.  Because some banks approve companies, not the vendor. So essentially, they would just have to send in a chat to them and say, hey, I need that.  To do a name change, and then the bank will tell them how to validate that. And then the bank is the one who updates the name.  There's only three fields for that.

42:08 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  What is the unique identifier between us and the backend in the system? There's different IDs that fly around.

42:15 - Jason
  So they have a vendor ID in Circle, and there's a bank ID as well.

42:20 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  a bank has its own vendor ID.

42:25 - Jason
  Yep, and each bank has their own bank identifier and their own set of IDs. And there's a link, there's linkage that links all, all that stuff together.  Okay. Thank you.

42:38 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So we really have to leave the control in the bank's hands because we can't force upon them.

42:43 - Sunda Scanlon
  Hey, you're taking this name change because they have their own processes and things, but that's only with first name, last name, and company.  A lot of times somebody will leave one of the nationals and go out on their own. And that bank may not approve them on their own for their own various reasons.  So they wouldn't use that vendor. So it has to be up to the bank what they accept and what they don't.

43:06 - Cody Miles
  So this isn't really like a rejection flow. Like I see it's written here as just ignore. Like we're just not going to update that record on our side.  But in your profile, on the vendor circle side of things, they can update whatever they want. Whatever they want.

43:20 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yep, exactly.

43:21 - Cody Miles
  But they don't have any visibility on what the bank has actually accepted or ignored. Exactly correct. Just like they don't have any visibility on bank grading or any other comment they put about the vendors.

43:32 - Sunda Scanlon
  Because that's the bank's information and they don't want them to know. Okay.

43:37 - Cody Miles
  That's helpful. Can we show the grading by any chance?

43:42 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Is that possible for us to show what grading looks like right now? Yeah, it's different for every single bank.

43:47 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yeah. So some banks will have just a dropdown of ABCDF. Some have words, good, okay, bad. Um... They had one bank that had horrible.  They're not with us anymore, but that used to crack me up. They can also have weighted averages and things.  So you might have great criteria like this where you have an explanation of grades up here, and then it might be a rating of one to five, one being the highest.  might be five to one, A through F. Again, it could be words. And then they just choose it. On the back end, it's numbers, and we just switch the numbers and the label to what they want, and then they can put in weighted averages for those grades.  And I've not seen any two banks have the same grading scale.

44:32 - Cody Miles
  So it's kind of hard, even though you're kind of normalizing it on the back end, you really couldn't take an aggregate across banks because the scale could be just entirely different.  And the requirements as well.

44:44 - Sunda Scanlon
  So some people say, okay, well, if they weren't on time, that's 50%. And then others consider it 10%. It's not as big of a deal.  So it's varied in their explanations of how they want their external reviewers or... For the internal reviewers to grade that vendor varies.  Again, every bank has different tolerances depending on the size of the bank, the area of the bank, and how strict their rules are, or their bylaws for keeping people on the approved appraiser list.  Some banks can't even get some people off they don't want on there because they have such strict requirements that they haven't failed X amount of times or whatever else, they still have to continue on the approved list.

45:28 - Cody Miles
  Interesting. Okay.

45:34 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Nice. Any other questions or stuff that you wanted to explore?

45:42 - Cody Miles
  Could you possibly show me where they're currently, just so I understand better, how are they currently in the chat giving that feedback on appraisal?  Yeah.

45:52 - Sunda Scanlon
  So either a job manager can chat with a vendor. So where they're... they're... they're... can Oh, think it's, conversations on event...  Vend engagement comes in. They're able to go back and forth to chat in a chat window and I'm on this bank one.  I'll show you a real life example. So this is the, so we have different chat windows that do this.  It says who made the chat and back and forth. So this is between lending and a job manager, but you have one right here.  So if they wanted to add a comment, they can make a comment and make a comment with attachments or anything else.  This is between the job manager and the vendor. And then once something's in review, at that point in time, the reviewer is able to chat back and forth.  And this is between the reviewer, whether they're internal or external and that vendor. So again, sometimes they'll just say, Hey, you need to fix this.  And it's a disputed type report where they need them to make corrections. Sometimes you'll see it to where they say, Hey, great job.  You know, nothing's needed. It just depends on the reviewer and their personality, which what I find is that they're even more dry than an appraiser.  They're very cut and dry. Like here it is. They're not going to give kudos. And then some are, the younger ones seem to be a little bit nicer.  No offense, Jeff, or anything. But the younger reviewers seem to be a little bit more where they'll give a little bit more feedback to the vendor versus the seasoned reviewers, which I don't know, maybe they're just tired of doing reviews, but they are just really matter of fact that you're not going to hear from them unless there's an issue.  And then they just want you to correct the issue. They don't even want to talk about it. I've seen plenty of appraisers reach out and say, hey, can we have a conversation?  And they'll say no, put it in the chat. So, you know, they're just, and I don't know what drives that, Jeff.  Maybe you do. Why the reviewers, but like Jeff said, they're doing a bunch of reviews. They just don't have the time to facilitate all the stuff with all these different appraisers because they have certain SLAs they have to meet for the bank and get the reviews done.

47:49 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yeah, I think because they're technicians and not business people. So they desperately would love feedback, but they've never had it historically.  So, again, if I do 10 appraisals, it would be good. Say, hey, Jeff, you did great on seven of them.  Two of them had issues. One was a piece of crap. They're not going to do it that way. But that's really, you know, the honesty.  Internally, they're kind of digging appraisers but not really telling them. And an appraiser could tell if they're getting a lot of pushback and if they submit, let's say they do five submittals and three of them get review comments, they can tell they're not doing well with that bank's particular reviewer.  I think the reviewer, to Sunda's point, the personality is kind of like somebody grading your, like a professor grading your test, only looking for mistakes, not giving kudos.  Even though there are times when there are kudos, they never hear it. They could do an awesome report and never even get anything.  There's an occasional less than 5% sentence where somebody would email or chat. I mean, that was an amazing report.  That was very rare. But I think it's required, and I think that's the point. When you create something new, especially with the UX, that you are creating a community, even if it's subtle.  Like, for example, I was on some site, I did something, and I got a little fake. Not that it has to be cheesy, but I got, like, confetti.  Yay! You know, that's kind of stupid, but it didn't make me feel like, oh, that was kind of nice.  But I'd really like the feedback from the reviewer teaching them to elevate the industry. Maybe that's just too much to ask in a UX.

49:33 - Sunda Scanlon
  Well, Jeff, maybe that's something that we need to send out as a survey as well to see if it's even, you know, worth going down that path.  No, it's just good. See our viewers would have participated. I call it chocolate and broccoli.

49:46 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  So the chocolate is what they want, which is to continue to do it the same way. The broccoli is what they need, which is to improve the relationship between each other.  Because what's happening right now, I call it the 50% problem. you. Thank Thank Thank On average, and it varies a lot, bank to bank, but on commercial appraisals, 50% of every report submitted is sent back for a revision.  It could be a small typo. It could be a structural issue. That's a very – that's poor. And those sides want to improve it, but they don't know how.  Does that make sense? Hmm. AI review.

50:26 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yeah.

50:26 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Anyway, more than you ever want to know.

50:31 - Sunda Scanlon
  But what we want them to concentrate on other than thinking about how we might be able to do a community is making the UI UX on the vendor circle itself since it's the new thing rolling out to make this look a little bit more inviting and whatnot.  And I'm sure eventually we'll have another tab up here that would be maybe stats or some other things that we could give them across all banks.  You know, used to make 10 reports and five of them were returned. Right. You know, in the month of October or whatever, some stuff like that.  So we'll eventually have some pretty stuff.

51:06 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  One thing that hasn't been done, which I'm not sure how it would be acceptable, would be if as a fee appraiser, how would I rate the bank?  How would I rate your reviewer for professionalism? How would I view your platform? In this case, Uconnect. How would I view the documents that you provided for me to do the appraisal?  The timeliness, professionalism. There is no, there's a grading going from the bank to the vendor. There is none going back.  And that's, that's really alien. That hasn't been done. What would that do, though, Jeff, do you think? All I'm trying to do is improve the communication a little bit, because I think a little bit is a lot of it.  So, for example, on that organization, we did a meeting on leadership. And these chief appraisers, not fee appraisers, but chief appraisers are going, I don't want to go to a seminar on leadership.  But when they experienced that elevation that, you know, they felt the vibe of leadership in their space, it's like, oh, wow, that is so cool.  They just haven't had it. So the reason that these platforms are arm's length is because nobody's tried to even hint at a community, to hint at improving their relationship between fee appraisers that, again, 50% of the revenue comes from bank work, yet they're derogatory towards bank work because of that arm's length, vendor, no feedback.  know, calling them a vendor is like they're selling potato chips as opposed to professional that really is well-educated. That's the disconnect.

52:43 - Sunda Scanlon
  What if you add something in Circle, right, when they go to Circle, what if we add another tab over here, if we start the community thing, that would be maybe a vendor kudos tab.  And if they put it in here. It would then appear for, they could do an at or whatever vendor by their email or whatever.  And then it would be a kudos that shows up over on the portal for that vendor.

53:11 - Jeff Hicks (Realwired)
  Yeah, I do think there needs to be an easy way and not to be overdone and not to be generic.  So if I got a, if uploaded a report and I got this generic, you're the best. You know what mean?  Every time get the same message, that's disingenuous. And that's actually going to turn me off even more than getting no feedback.

53:32 - Cody Miles
  But it does sound like just, you know, in the opportunity of approving an order, there is a small opportunity to provide positive feedback.  I mean, you don't have to tell them they're the best every time, right?

53:46 - Sunda Scanlon
  Right. Right.

53:50 - Cody Miles
  So just to make sure I'm kind of following the narrative well and just tell me where I get this wrong.  But the scope of the effort here that is expected of Val and I... at of look at the and look to look Thank  Is one to identify, you know, the mechanisms that from the bank side that we can work into the UX and the product to encourage the bank to leave that positive feedback, you know, potentially following the approval of appraisal or like you said, Sunda, maybe just like more generically just being able to send someone kudos.  But on the vendor side of it, I understand that we're kind of looking for a overall better UX of this platform and also to surface, you know, those feedback loops, you know, even if they're just at aggregate, right?  Like, how are we doing? What are the positive things being said about me? You know, what are my benchmarks?  Is that probably the right way to think about it? Was that last question coming from the vendor asking the chief appraiser or the bank something?  Well, from the vendor logging into this platform and getting that feedback loop, but maybe it's only at aggregate. Maybe it's not like the specific feedback of a person, but maybe we do need to surface.  The specific feedback of someone. Well, I think that's phase two to think about, right?

55:09 - Sunda Scanlon
  Our phase one is for the UI UX for the vendors when they come into the new platform here. So phase one is just an overall better UX of the current functionality.

55:20 - Cody Miles
  Yeah. And vendor circle, correct?

55:22 - Sunda Scanlon
  Is that right, Ben? Yeah. And vendor circle, yeah.

55:24 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah.

55:25 - Sunda Scanlon
  And then after we have this and we launch it because it's not launched yet, then we can start, you know, brainstorming about what can we do for maybe community or to add benefit.  Okay. Got it. Got it.

55:42 - Cody Miles
  Cool. Well, I appreciate the sync on this, guys. I appreciate understanding the vision and the goals of what you're doing and also the phase one goals.  So it makes sense just looking at like my request page, for example, there's some UX principles that we can just really easily incorporate into here.  Make a big lift in terms of user experience. Amazing. The thing that would help me would, of course, be access to this dev environment.  So if that's possible, that'd be nice. Yeah, we can make sure that that's set up.

56:15 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Sunda, could you just get the credentials to? Well, it's not a set of credentials.

56:19 - Sunda Scanlon
  You have to do an email address. So you would do your own email. Okay. So what I can do is give you this link, and you'll, right now, it's, I don't think it's locked down to anything.  Jason? Let's change this process.

56:35 - Jason
  Send us one or two email addresses or however many you need, and we'll set you up because I want to make sure there's data there.  Okay.

56:43 - Sunda Scanlon
  Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, so Jason, I'm happy to do that.

56:47 - Cody Miles
  It'll just be Val and I, though. So Val at Brand Cave and Cody at Brand Cave.co. Perfect.

56:52 - Jason
  Is there any chance that can be sent or emailed? Yeah.

56:56 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Thanks, Tim. Thank you.

57:01 - Cody Miles
  All right. Okay. Well, guys, I don't think I have any other questions.

57:07 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  All right. Thanks, everybody. Okay. Have a great weekend and holidays. Thank you, guys. Thanks. Bye.
